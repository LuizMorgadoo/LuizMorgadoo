### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

#I'm Luiz Morgado, an engineering student and tech enthusiast. Currently, I work with research at the Water Resources Laboratory of the Federal University of CearÃ¡. I started using data manipulation and treatment techniques in my research, which sparked my interest and led me to start learning about data science!
